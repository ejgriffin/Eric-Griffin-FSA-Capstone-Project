Bananazon

1.  This is a basic e-commerce site called Bananazon (like Amazon but with a banana).
    using this API: https://fakestoreapi.com/
2.  Here is a link to the deployed app: https://65baca5165b4cc2d35000eba--quiet-kheer-d140b5.netlify.app/
3.  The registration page creates an object id, but you cannot login with the new user as it doesn't get added to the API. Here is a list of users from the API that you can use to test:

        username: johnd,
        password: m38rmF$

        username: mor_2314
        password: 83r5^_

        username: kevinryan
        password: kev02937@

        username: donero
        password: ewedon

4.  If you click on the cart icon immediately after logging in, you should be able to load a cart from the API that is specific to that user. This cart can be edited.
